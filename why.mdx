## Our story

Like many sofware products, tile.run was born out of our own needs. We are the team behind [Kili](https://kili.so), a document processing platform for business teams.

While building Kili, we found that document extraction was an unsolved problem. It was easy for us to get to 60-70% accuracy but challenging to get to 80-90% accuracy.

We spent a lot of time optimising our extraction engine. After talking to several users, we realised that several developers were after a similar solution.
