## Coming soon

We are planning on tackling the following problems in order of priority:

- Improve accuracy: we will keep iterating to improve accuracy of extraction.
- Support more data types: add support for additional data types like .xls, .csv, audio and video files.
- Add bounding boxes for every extraction to make verification easy
- Support self-hosted deployments
